# Data Analysis with Python

This notebook is an integral part of my Data Analysis study track, representing one of the final tasks of the IBM-Coursera Professional Data Analyst certification course.

In this task, I addressed ten questions in a specific context: The Trust has expressed interest in investing in residential real estate, and I, as a Data Analyst working in a Real Estate Investment Trust, was entrusted with the responsibility of determining the market value of a home using a set of resources. My task was to analyze and predict real estate prices based on various attributes or features, such as square footage, number of rooms, number of floors, and so on.
